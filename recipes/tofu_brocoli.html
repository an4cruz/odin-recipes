        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I wanted to create a simple recipe for this lunch, I checked out what I had in the fridge and I created this mix, that goes well with peas(that i already had in the fridge, just added vegan cheese to it).</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>200g of tofu (I used the paprika one) cut into cubes</li>
            <li>1/2 chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 chopped ail</li>
            <li>1/2 broccoli cut in small parts</li>
            <li>1 carrot cut in slices</li>
            <li>1 vegetable broth</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put Olive oil in a frying pan (in medium/high heat) and add the onions and ail, let it become golden</li>
            <li>Add the vegetable broth and 50ml of water, the broccoli and the carrot</li>
            <li>Put the lid on the pan and let it simmer for 5 minutes (medium heat)</li>
            <li>Add the tofu and mix it with a spoon, let it simmer for 5 minutes more</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat</li>
            <li>Serve it with peas and cheese or whatever you like</li>
        </ol>
