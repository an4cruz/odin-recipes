        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Dilma <del>ex-president of Brazil </del>would say that the Manioc made us begin civilized humans, and we should salute it. I would say we should salute <strong> bananas </strong>also. Banana is the base of every brazilian. We eat everything with bananas, farofa, cakes, even rice and beans</p>
