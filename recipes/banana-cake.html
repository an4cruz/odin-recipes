        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Dilma would say that the Manioc made us begin civilized humans, I would say it was banana. Banana is the base of every brazilian. We eat everything with bananas, farofa, cakes, even rice and beans</p>
        <p>And who doesn't love a good banana cake in the afternoon with a cup of coffee? So, I introduce you to the traditional banana cake from Brazil (in it's vegan version, of course.)</p>
